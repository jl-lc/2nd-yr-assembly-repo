## Project 3 - Assembly Counter & Reflex-Meter
8 LEDs on the board counts from 0-255 (0x0 - 0xFF) at 10Hz from the simple counter subroutine for correctness of output interfacing. For the reflex-meter, a pseudorandom number generator subroutine is called for a random delay within the range of 2 to 10 seconds +/- 0.25%. P1.29 LED will turn on after the random amount of delay and the increment subroutine polls P2.10 push button every 0.1ms for user input. Once pressed, the 8 LEDs displays from the least significant 8 bits to the most significant 8 bits in increments, resulting in a 32-bit number (max. 429496.7296s = 119.3hrs) shown as the resulting reaction time of the user in units of 0.1 ms (divide result by 10000 for result in seconds).
